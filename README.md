## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.

## Idea
An E-waste Facility Locator tackles the challenge of responsible e-waste disposal by connecting users with nearby drop-off locations. This user-friendly platform allows people to search for facilities based on their location and provides details like accepted items, hours of operation, and any associated fees. It also educates users on what constitutes e-waste and the importance of proper recycling.

## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram
The "E-Waste Facility Locator" proposes a digital solution to address the challenge of proper electronic waste (e-waste) disposal by providing a user-friendly platform for locating nearby facilities that accept e-waste. Here's the proposed solution: 1.Database of E-Waste Facilities: The solution involves compiling a comprehensive database of e-waste recycling centers, drop-off locations, and other facilities that accept electronic waste for recycling or proper disposal. This database would include details such as addresses, contact information, accepted items, operating hours, and any specific instructions for disposal. 2.User-Friendly Interface: The platform would feature a user-friendly interface, accessible via web or mobile application, where users can easily search for e-waste facilities based on their location or specific criteria. The interface would prioritize simplicity and ease of use to encourage widespread adoption. 3.Location-Based Search: Users would be able to input their location or allow the app to access their geolocation data to find nearby e-waste facilities. The solution would provide relevant search results based on proximity, ensuring convenience for users seeking to dispose of their e-waste responsibly.
